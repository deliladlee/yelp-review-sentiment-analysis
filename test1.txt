I ordered the grilled cheese donut since the rest of the menu didn't seem to be that appealing, having been to The Daily Melt, Ms. Cheezious, and New York Grilled Cheese Co. - all of which makes excellent grilled cheese sandwiches. So I figured I would try something different. But the problem is this: the grilled cheese doughnut is far more savory than sweet - which defeats the purpose of ordering a sandwich with doughnut in the first place. And I ordered the bananarama version, which includes caramelized bananas and smoked gouda - and nope, even the caramelized bananas did not make it any sweeter.

So unfortunately, overall, this place was a flop. And then I figured out why - it's a chain, and a big one. Didn't know until I looked into their website. The other places I had been to for grilled cheese concotions were all local places that were serious about the flavor profile of grilled cheese sandwiches (as they should be - or otherwise, I'd just make it at home).

NOTE: The donut was cut in half and then the filling goes in between. But the donuts are grilled first inside, which changes the flavor of the donut itself. But I'm no expert on this matter since this was after all, the first time I had a donut sandwich. But the flavor is just not worth the price and extra calories.
