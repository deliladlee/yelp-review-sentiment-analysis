I've been here a couple of times and loved it. I usually get the bbq bacon burger because I like it so much. They also have amazing queso and really good drinks.

The place is clean and the staff is helpful. We brought my friends dog and they got him a water dish as soon as they saw him. The patio is a really nice. They have spritzer fans that keep it nice even on the hottest summer days. 

This place is a great place to spend spend an afternoon and get some good food.

Fantastic casual place for great burgers and fries. 

You order and pay when you first walk in. Then you are given a metal number to hang off the paper towel rack at the table of your choosing. 

They run the food out to you. Servers check in to see if you need anything (mayo, mustard, drink refills, etc..). If you decide at the table to add something to your order (like a delicious milkshake) The server can open a new tab for you with your credit card. 

The sweet potato fries are really delicious! The double down (double pattys, double cheese) is huge!

You can customize your burger with things like bacon, avocado, a fried egg, sautéed mushrooms, etc...

This is a great place to bring the family or to have a team night with the people from work.

I was in Richardson for a conference and stopped here for a burger afterwards.  The food was tasty and the service was excellent.  You order at the counter and food is brought to you, but there is a server to brings drinks from the bar.  If you want to order more, the server can open up a tab for you.  I ordered the fried pickles and these were some of the best I've had.  They are unassumingly spicy and that made them even more yummy.  My burger was cooked perfectly and the buns they have are great!!  So good.  I tried my friends' fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries and onion rings are delicious!!!  The regular fries were a little over cooked but everything else was so good, I wasn't phased.  The place was packed and it looked as though everyone was having a great time.  I definitely recommend this burger spot!!

Very good burger (had the mushroom and Swiss) and great onion rings.  The porch and setting is very comfortable and even a golfer drove his cart up to the restaurant. Would definitely try it again.

I ordered the bacon BBQ while my friend ordered a regular burger with japalenos.  The burger was dry and the BBQ sauce on the burger was over-whelming. And the japalenos tasted off. They messed up on our order and it took us a while to flagged down a server to address that. Overall it wasn't worth the price.

Okay, so I am full as a tick for about $23.00 (lunch). Not bad. The udon soup was really good, the spicy tuna tempura sushi is DELICIOUS (the smaller pieces are spicy tuna, not sure what the bigger pieces are), and the glasses are crystal clear which I really liked (I'm easy to impress that way). 

Good food, but nothing that you haven't seen in a Japanese/Asian fusion buffet.

It's an OK place. They have many kinds of food but I would say most friendly to Sushi and Sashimi lovers. Other food like soup, hotpot, craw fish, and deserts are just so so. I went there several times and was very excited the first time. After that, I would only go with Sushi and Sashimi. Also, the service is kind of slow. One time, I picked all my food on the table but have to wait for 10 min. to get my knives and forks be severed. Sometimes, It can be very loud and crowed there. 

For the same price, I would rather go to JT 5 or Sake to me Sushi.

I really enjoyed this place. Tokyo One and Osaka have aspects that are better and worse.

Here's the deal!

All of the Vietnamese side of my family prefer Osaka and/or Tokyo One.

All the Anglo side of my family prefer Japan House.

We "All" agree that going to any of these places is for family get together s. 

Birthday person eats free!!!

Do you like being ripped off?

Do you like being essentially seated in the waiting area and having people leaning into you and on your table throughout your meal?

Do you like having the waiter quietly give himself a $15 tip for your dinner for two?

Me neither.  Don't go here.

-----
We are long time aficionados of sushi, to include sushi buffets and, more generally, Japanese buffets.  We have been irregular customers of this restaurant since it opened.

Today, we are officially done with this restaurant.

We came in earlier this week and they told us of a great deal where we could come back Friday and get a 2-for-1 deal on dinner as long as we ordered drinks.

So, we came back Friday, and ordered two *bottles* of sake.

Apparently, seating a gazillion people in their gigantic restaurant was not enough.  They had to cram tables into the bar area to get a half dozen more.  Greedy.

They seat us at one of these tables, tucked under the bar, the edge of the bar a foot or two from our heads.  Then they proceed to let the scores of people waiting for tables to flood into the restaurant, so we literally had people bumping into us and leaning on our tables.

But hey, good news, we only had the *second* worst table in the restaurant.  Some poor couple was literally seated smack in a pass through area, so people had to squeeze around them constantly.

We ask the staff if they can do something about it.

Attempt #1: Confused...flee!
Attempt #2: The manager. She asks the few people standing right next to our table to stand a little farther away.  That works for about 3 minutes.
Attempt #3: Nothing.

Oh and then there was the waiter that showered my wife with ice as he pulled bottles of some drink from an open cooler that they chose to position about two feet from our table.

What about our waiter?  Well, we saw him at the very start of our meal and the very end.  So, not so useful, but he apparently did not see it that way.  There were only two of use, but he decided to...

GIVE HIMSELF A $15.00 TIP, BAKED INTO THE BILL.

So I go to the manager and her answer is, basically: "Oh, yeah, that's how it should be because we have this discount thing."

WTF?

With our two bottles of Sake, without the discount, our total would have been a hair under $100, $67 with the discount.  So, old Scott-who-has-shown-his-face-twice-during-our-meal has given himself a %15 to %22 tip, depending on how you slice it. And...

NO ONE WARNED US OF THIS AUTOMATIC TIP.

A surprise tip is like getting a fortune cookie, if a fortune cookie was a turd that cost $15. :-P

[For the record, this is not normal, and many would argue that the base tip for a *buffet* is lower than a typical full service restaurant.]

We are done with this place forever and we recommend you not support them.

If you want a sushi/Japanese buffet, do yourself a favor and head to Osaka Sushi near Preston and Park.  They have never tried to shaft us and their food quality is always great.

All you can eat sushi, hot pot, coco fountain! What more can you ask for. Service was good and prompt. Servers would polite and efficient. Food was good and plentiful and fresh. I would definitely recommend.

I am a huge grilled cheese and tomato soup lover. It's my go-to food if I'm feeling sick, cold, down or hungry.

I wish I'd thought of opening Tom+Chee. 

I met up with a friend at the new Tom+Chee in the DFW metroplex. It's tucked away in the new Cityline development in Richardson. I drove around the entire development before I figured out how to get to the restaurant - save yourself some time and gas by turning in on State Street. Free 2-hour parking is available on the street or you can park in one of the many parking garages on the property (there are plenty of visitor spaces).

The menu offers a huge variety of choice, from your plain grilled cheese to meat-and-cheese options. Or you can create your own sandwich, which is pretty awesome. You also have choice when it comes to soup - there are multiple types of tomato and non-tomato soup to enjoy.

I ordered a shroom and swiss, with a cup of regular tomato soup. The sandwich came on pumpernickel bread with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and swiss cheese. 

I was a latchkey kid growing up, and grilled cheese was one of the few "fancy" snacks I was allowed to make at home alone. My approved to cook alone version was three thin slices of longhorn-style Colby jack, tucked inside two pieces of toasted bread, microwaved for 25 seconds or until the cheese was melty.

It's important to share that because it tells you a lot about how I like a grilled cheese - melty, but not greasy. I found Tom+Chee's sandwich to be slightly greasier than I prefer. Lots and lots of napkins and finger wiping required.

The lesson learned for me is that when I go back, I'll tell them not to butter/oil my bread or the griddle. Or maybe I'll tell them to do half as much as they normally do as a test. Either will get the sandwich closer to what I'm used to after X (way too many to put in writing) years of eating grilled cheese sandwiches.

The soup was really yum. Very tomato-ey in flavor - so good. It wasn't my standby of Campbell's tomato prepared with a can of skim milk, but I liked it a lot. I'd definitely order it again and a cup was the perfect size to enjoy with my sandwich.

The space is super fun - bright yellow and red, with lots of seating options from 2 and 4-tops to a bar that looks out onto the street. Perfect for when you want to eat alone and check Facebook.

Orders are delivered to your table. Drinks are self serve and are the standard soda-water-tea...but they do have a bowl of fresh lemon slices. Great touch.

Napkins, if you need them (you'll definitely need them) are all at the drink station, so get what you need before you head to your table.

I was excited to try this after seeing it on shark tank. When I entered, I was met by one of the rudest uninterested in me cashiers I've ever run into (Eric). I asked what the most popular item was and his response was "I don't know I don't eat anything here". I then asked if the donuts were good, his response was "the blueberry is the only good one". When I asked about the tomato soup, once again he responded rudely by saying "it's ok".  Had it not been for the great food he would have ruined my experience. 

I helped myself to the bbq cheese sandwich and the Smore's donut along with the tomato soup. 

Wow the tomato soup stole the show. So good! The bbq sandwich was very good but messy. The brisket was thinly sliced and a bit chewy and not as tender as I care for, but I still managed to finish it. Very good!

The Smore's donut was spectacular. So doing that again. 

Would have been 5 stars had it not been for the rude unhelpful millennial

Grilled cheese's are my cheat food. Therefore, whenever I  eat one it has to be amazing, which is why I chose to drive to Tom+Chee rather than make one myself at home. Not the best decision..
I'm pretty sure they use kraft singles for their cheddar because my sandwich was so under cooked that I could easily pull apart the two perfectly square, perfectly even, slices of cheese. If I'm going to pay $6 for a grilled cheese I expect them to at least use quality products. Their profit margin must be insane as you could probably make 6 grilled cheese for what they charge you for one. I also expect there to be a little more cheese, as with two super thin slices you can barely even taste it. I didn't even finish half of it before I threw it out...
I do like that they offer gluten free and vegan options, but considering vegan cheese is cheaper than real cheese (as long as you are actually buying REAL cheese and not kraft) it really doesn't make sense that they charge extra for it.

I ordered the grilled cheese donut since the rest of the menu didn't seem to be that appealing, having been to The Daily Melt, Ms. Cheezious, and New York Grilled Cheese Co. - all of which makes excellent grilled cheese sandwiches. So I figured I would try something different. But the problem is this: the grilled cheese doughnut is far more savory than sweet - which defeats the purpose of ordering a sandwich with doughnut in the first place. And I ordered the bananarama version, which includes caramelized bananas and smoked gouda - and nope, even the caramelized bananas did not make it any sweeter.

So unfortunately, overall, this place was a flop. And then I figured out why - it's a chain, and a big one. Didn't know until I looked into their website. The other places I had been to for grilled cheese concotions were all local places that were serious about the flavor profile of grilled cheese sandwiches (as they should be - or otherwise, I'd just make it at home).

NOTE: The donut was cut in half and then the filling goes in between. But the donuts are grilled first inside, which changes the flavor of the donut itself. But I'm no expert on this matter since this was after all, the first time I had a donut sandwich. But the flavor is just not worth the price and extra calories.

What a strange concept! But it seems to work, this place is busy on a Friday evening, in a place I never suspected. It's in the new State Farm complex, and you would never see it from the road.
I had some delicious bacon chicken soup, and followed up with a Choco Bacon Bliss grilled cheese donut. It probably should be illegal to eat one of those by yourself. Really.
Huge fan in the dining area might need to be set to super slow. 
I have yet to try a real grilled cheese, the Choco Bacon Bliss is more of a desert. 
Lively place. Quite loud inside.

Outstanding again!! This time I brought the office to enjoy the food, service and atmosphere of my favorite restaurant. As has been my experience every time, it was a home run!! Michael was a great help steering us through the lunch menu! You guys have a great staff!!

Now about your food... I can't seem to find a menu item that doesn't impress! This time I tried the chicken sandwich with fries. Oh my god! It was wonderful! And those pickles... Tasty!! The table enjoyed the Midwesterner, Ahi Tower, Chicken Gouda Lasagna and Chicken Caesar Salad. Rave reviews were given by all! The patio won raves too!!

For the appropriate ending I suggested dessert but couldn't convince everyone to partake in the fabulousness. I knew the deal, though. We took a slice of Reese's Pieces and coconut cream pie with us to share. OMG!! Scrumptious!!! 

Marcus Cafe has created a co-dependent relationship with me. I'm sure the others will be returning but not as soon as me! Love this place!!!

Great spot hidden in Canyon Creek!  Consistently delicious specials and the Risotto melts in your mouth! Bread is delicious! Always a plus.

Wonderful service always and they are very attentive no matter how large or small your party is. Love being so close to this restaurant!

Want a local place to succeed but we keep trying Marcus Cafe everytime they change their ownership or theme and it always disappoints.  The food is just not good.  No matter what we try or how many times they try to update their menu, it just fails.  Could be a good bar, but their beer list is subpar as well.  The location and atmosphere have potential but can't endorse a restaurant whose food is not good.

I was in culinary heaven yesterday. Had the El Cubano sandwich at Marcus Cafe and for the first time in years I was pleased to say the least. The Soup De Jours was exquisite as well and it was the best food I have had in Dallas yet. Ambiance at the terrace was great and the owner is the Chef (French) who knows how to cook. Will go there many times from now.

I've have thrown a few showers and various other get together a here. They are very accommodating as long as you give them notice. Their patio is beautiful!!!!!! Huge wine selection.

This was such a wonderful find!!! It's been nearly impossible to find nor authentic Mexican dishes (vs. Tex Mex) sine we moved here. Both brunch and regular menu items have been enjoyed by the fam  - too numerous to count. My favorite item by far, however,  is their sampler appetizer platter - it's very difficult to find a sope in TX and not only does this platter represent, it does it well and the tamale isn't too shabby either. Margaritas are very inexpensive and are very tasty - they even knew what a Paloma was! And what can I say about the chips and salsa? Plentiful and tasty - your table will never be lacking!

Service has always been fantastic whether every table has been packed or it's been quiet. It's great for kids but also has a good sized bar where you can hang out and watch the game as well.

I love this place! It is a nice and somewhat secluded, but it's great for a quick dinner. I have only been here twice and have never had a problem with the service. They remind me a lot of casa mama's in terms of what they offer menu wise. 

I have had the brisket tacos and calamari tacos and was not at all disappointed in the flavor or portion size. I loved the margarita's because they are actually strong and not drowned in sweet & sour. My boyfriend always gets the sour cream enchiladas so if that is your thing, you will be content. I recommend giving them a go the next time you're out and about in the Richardson area.

My family and I ate there tonight and were so impressed!  The service was perfect -- between several servers, our chips were never out and our salsa was refilled several times from a chilled salsa pitcher.  My tea only got 1/2 empty before it was refilled.  

We had 3 kids under age 5 with us, and the servers were SO friendly to them and accommodating.  My youngest thew up on me, so we had to leave quickly -- and our server was SO quick to ask if everything was alright, to get us to-go boxes, and to get our check.  

The food was wonderful.   The salsa is very garlicy, cilantro-y, and peppery.  We REALLY liked it.  The brisket taco was perfect -- just great meat in a grilled tortilla with some salsa and cilantro/onions on the side.  The egg burrito with fries was also GREAT.  We loved everything we ordered, actually.  

We will definitely be going back!  Mi Cocina is our go-to with our little ones b/c the atmosphere/noise puts us at ease, and I wasn't sure how it would go at this place, but everyone was so welcoming and wonderful!  We recommend it!

I've been to Frankie's on two separate occasions; one was with a friend for dinner on a weekday. The other was a bridal shower for another coworker (that I apparently don't remember..long story). Anyway, both visits were pleasant and not out of the ordinary. This time, however, my experience was marred.

I called to make a reservation for a coworker's baby shower a week ago. I told him there would be about 20 people on Friday at 4:00. His first question was: Will you be ordering just drinks or will you get food also? He told me that Fridays are busy and that he needs those tables for customers, so he wanted to know if we could be done by 6. I thought I was a customer also?
So whatever. I assured him we could be done by 6 and yes, we would order food and drinks. He repeated about 3 times about leaving at 6.

Fast forward to yesterday and 13 people had rsvped. I called again to confirm our reservation and changed the party size to 13. Whoever I had on the phone this time didn't see to mind (or care). 

So today I go early to set up. The manager (so he seems) guides me to the back where it's a little dark. I notice a patio section that's brighter and covered so I ask about that area (where we had the bridal shower), and he says something like we can't use that area because there's another party using it. 
He doesn't seem very pleased as I bring in balloons and vases for flowers. 
I start setting up and he walks by several times. A guy on the wait staff is kind enough to ask if I need anything and helps me pour water into the vases. He also asks me a few minutes later when I am finished setting up and brings me water.

The manager, on the other hand, must have remembered who I was (from the phone) and asks me again to confirm that we will leave by 6. My coworker is so offended she stared him down as she replied that we too, are paying customers. Go girl.
Anyway our waiter, Carlos, is fantastic, still new and learning but courteous.

The food was ok, if not a little salty. I ordered the calamari tacos, which were decent, but I was slightly confused about the veggie stir fry on the side. At first I thought it was a side, but realized it might be for the taco, since my first bite was super salty. The queso appetizer was delicious (melted cheese can't go wrong).

My only issue is with management. I don't understand how you can treat a customer with such disregard and lack of common sense. I understand Fridays get busy. But how can you tell a paying customer to eat with a time limit? When I got there, the place was 1/4 full. By the end of our meal, it was 3/4 full with several tables available. It's not like we were belligerent, loud, and obnoxious patrons that only ordered drinks. We were a group of 13 educators who wanted to celebrate a baby shower after a long week of work. I was constantly checking my phone for the time so we wouldn't go over 6. I find that absolutely ridiculous. No matter how good the food is, Service and customer satisfaction need to be your top priority as a restaurant owner. That's what keeps you coming back. I don't think I will ever use Frankie's for a party or event.

If you are going here for dinner with a friend, go for it. But book your party of 8+ somewhere else.

Oh, and we left on the dot at 6:00. You're welcome, Frankie.

Dropped in last Friday to try it....and we are hooked! Visited on Friday and came back on Saturday.

I ordered the TexMex plate that comes with a crispy taco, sour cream chicken enchilada, rice, beans, and a cheese enchilada. For ~8.00, it was a home run.

The taco was crunchy, mix of cheese and pico, and lightly flavored beef. Yum.

The Mexican rice...the best I've had at ANY Mexican restaurant. Fresh tasting, not dry, great flavor.

The enchiladas are what brought me back Fri/Sat. The chicken isn't shredded, it's blenderized and packed with flavor. The cheese enchilada isn't yellow cheddar, its a white cheese. While it comes with tomatillo sauce (not a fan), I asked for sour cream sauce and it knocked out of the park.

The service is good, drinks get filled consistently, and they play music from some service that I really liked. Bonus.

Bottom Line: We'll be back. Great flavor in the food, fresh, and very affordable.

Fantastic x100.   Tasty on a hot day.   Even tastier on a cold & wet day, which occurs far too often in the winter here.   Surprised to find a place of this quality here in Dallas.   After moving here recently from Los Angeles,  I thought that great Shabu could not be had.  I've never been so thrilled to be wrong.

Get a medium entree, as the side items fill you up much more than you think.   Our server Fred took his time to pamper us with how to ready properly.   Also, he hand prepared all the sauces and cooked the finishing noodle stage like a master. Best server ever.

My expectation is really high due to the rating. But the fact let me down for the following:
1. the service is slow, including refill, bring meat over and adding water to the pot(although the attitude is good).
2. the meat is not worth the price. we pay $26 to get less than 20 pieces of meat and the taste of the meat is just so so.
3. the source is less tasty than Chinese hot pot.
#####

It was delicious!!! The service was awesome. **make a reservation! 
Ask for the spicy soup base, and a poached egg for the soup. Sit at the bar!! It adds to the experience. 
The prime rib was SO GOOD!
#####

My expectations were extremely high due to all of the ratings and reviews, but we were honestly let down. 

We arrived in a party of five to a completely empty restaurant. It took nearly 30 minutes before our meats were finally brought out. Our server was rude and really had a difficult personality to enjoy. I had asked for gluten free items only, and asked about whether or not their potato noodles were gluten free. The server responded back with, "They're made out of potatoes, ma'am". Actually, a manager came back and informed me that they were made with a potato starch, and asked me to do some research before chowing down. I could not eat the udon noodles.

Meats that I ordered were pork and choice beef (pork is not on the menu, by the way). Meats really were delicious, but for the price, there really wasn't a lot. We ended with a soup noodle with the broth that we ended up making with the veggies and meats. I'm pretty sure that the ponzu sauce that was used to season the broth was not gluten free, because I felt dizzy, extremely bloated, and sick after my meal. 

If you have a larger party, more than 2, be prepared to have to share your hot pot, unless you do your meal at the bar. It really isn't suited for parties of 4 or more, unless you want to sit at the bar. The home style tables come with two hotpots, a small table, and enough seating for four only. If you have someone who is vegetarian or allergic to foods, it makes sharing hot pots very difficult.

Oh my goodness it's been a while since I've enjoyed a meal as much as I enjoyed this one.  Just what the doctor ordered on a cool, sunny Fall day.  Shabu shabu is the type of meal that never ends!  

Step 1: Say hi and sit down.  The servers will start seasoning with garlic and green onions and boiling your broth for you.  If you've never been here before don't be afraid to ask how shabu shabu works.  Everyone is very friendly and willing to help you!

Step 2: Raw veggies will be served to you.  Choose the hard veggies to put in the broth first like the carrots, squash, and broccoli.  Then put in half of the napa cabbage, saving the rest for later when you add the noodles.

Step 3: Order your meats.  Word of advice: get your money's worth by ordering the prime steak ribeye and salmon.  The beef is thinly sliced and as such will cook within seconds of being soaked in the broth.  

Step 4: Enjoy your meats, veggies, seasoned sauces, and rice.  Dip your meats  in the broth or take your veggies out, then dunk in the sauce, then eat with a heapful of perfectly cooked rice.  There are three delicious sauces that are served: a tangy, soy sauce with green onions, a peanut-miso sauce, and a sweet teriyaki sauce.  They're all good!  I loved all the sauces!  If you want more meat, order a-la-carte.  It's cheaper.

Step 5: Noodle time.  You can ask your server to do this for you.  Yummmm...Udon and vermicelli noodles in the most delicious, flavorful, and deep broth you can imagine.  Trust me, you'll be surprised that you made that broth.  I seasoned my noodle soup with lots of hot pepper flakes and chili oil since I like spicy foods.  But the plain broth by itself is just as satisfying.

I can say with 100% certainty that I will be back.  This place is such a great and unique experience.  My only regret is that I didn't try this place earlier.

It was Tuesday, and Cinco De Mayo, so it should be Taco Tuesday right? Seems that's not much of a big deal here in Dallas as it is in San Diego, however, this place serves up some really good and unique tacos. I had a two taco plate with beef, rice, & black beans. First of all even though it's like a taco shop, they use real dishes and not just everything blobbed on a plate. They give you a nice tray with the beans and rice in cute square porcelain dishes. The atmosphere is very modern not your typical taco shop atmosphere, which made it very pleasant to enjoy my meal. The best part was the Margarita, a good sized, real glass with a great Margarita, salt on the edge. The price was very reasonable, sure beat the fast food taco shop I was on my way to when I saw this place. Looking forward to exploring more on their menu. 

They were also more than happy to help me make some good gluten free choices for my meal.

Sticky tables even before the dinner rush - they needed to be wiped clean better. 

Something smelled around the soda fountain. The bathroom next door perhaps?

Tacos are good though. I tried the Latin Love and Cabo Fish. 

The Latin Love consists of shredded beef, refried black beans, salsa verde, fried plantains, cotija cheese and I thought it was still missing something. It was just okay but this one left me feeling underwhelmed.

The Cabo Fish, on the other hand, was a real winner. It consists of beer battered (could also be grilled) cod, jicama slaw, chipotle cream sauce, pico de gallo. The codfish was plump and delicious - good quality.

I would go back, even if it's just for the fish tacos. But I'll also try some other stuff next time.

Shrimp and grilled fish tacos were excellent. Also they have a nice selection of vegetarian tacos (3). 

A few areas for improvement:
1) chips and guac--underwhelming. Chips were too thin to scoop guac and kept breaking. Guac could use more cilantro and pepper/spice/kick.
2) black beans and rice served as part of the "taco plate" were not much to write home about. Black beans were refried (which is fine), but were too runny/thin and ultimately not satisfying.

Overall really enjoyed the tacos and will return despite living fairly far from the restaurant.
#####

Nothing to write home about. I was expecting more from the high rating. Breaded fish tacos were OK, but I really wish the fish was chopped up instead of a huge hunk of battered fish wrapped in the tortilla.

Another place recommended for me to try.  Went with a party of three.  Restaurant was clean with lots of metal accents and murals on the walls.  Seats about 90 people.

Order at the counter.  Food when ready is brought out to you.  

Started with the queso dip (very good - could probably eat a bucket of the stuff) 

Main course was an order of Ancho Garlic Shrimp tacos (Grilled shrimp, plantain pico de gallo, shredded spinach, flour tortilla - 2 tacos to an order) with rice and beans.  The tacos were OUTSTANDING.  Good amount of shrimp with just the right amount of spicy kick without being overpowering.  Rice and bean portions were very small.  Beans were more a puree than anything, but did taste pretty good mixed with the rice.  

Also had the Pura Vida Veggie tacos (black beans, lettuce, guacamole, plantains, cilantro, red onions, serrano peppers, spinach, flour tortilla).  These were proclaimed to be good by the people I was eating with, but just a wee bit too much spice which was slightly off putting.

The salsa that comes with the meal looks a bit more like ketchup than salsa.  I like spicy, but I don't think this has the depth of flavor I am usually looking for...it was simply hot.

Counter service was friendly and helpful with suggestions.

I would definitely come back to get the Ancho Garlic Shrimp Tacos - Very Tasty.  

Three stars only because of small side portions of rice and beans and the taste of the salsa.  

Oh, and they are getting ready to open a 2nd restaurant in Frisco.

Best Jamaican food in DFW!  
Very authentic and fresh. The owner Jr says it best..."I'm not just running a business, I'm building a legacy."
Food is amazing!

A wonderfully hidden gem. Who knew you could get authentic Caribbean food in Richardson? Well JC is definitely that!! The food, staff &  atmosphere are incredible. 

We had the shrimp curry, oxtail, beef patties & jerk chicken & all were excellent!

Come check them out, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Lunch during the weekday seems slow but Junior was good at making sure all the tables were happy. The menu is also limited - and is much larger at other times of the day.

Patties seem to be popular here even though it's not home-made. I have no qualms with that since the other Jamaican place by downtown Dallas didn't have good patties - I would prefer a good patty over a any bad one. 

They don't have roti - only sometimes. Call in advance to inquire about it or check their Facebook page. 

Curried chicken comes with two pieces of stewed dark meat chicken in curry, potatoes and carrots. Sides includes rice and peas (really rice and beans), fried plantains, and shredded cabbage with peppers. 

All was flavorful and good, with generous portions (thanks mostly to the sides, but I liked them) for the $7.99 lunch special price. Much more authentic tasting Jamaican than the place by downtown Dallas. 

Grocery store isn't really a grocery store - it's too small to be considered that.

So, on my quest to find good Jamaican food in the Dallas area, I stopped by last fall during my lunch. I decided to get my food to go and eat back at the office. I picked up an order for a co-worker too. She was less than happy with the portion sizes compared to the high price. I thought my food was just okay, not enough to make me want to hurry back.

Fast forward to summer 2015. Stopped by on a Saturday with a coworker. We stood at the front waiting to be seated. Nope. After several minutes, we sat at a booth. Nope. No one ever came over. There was only one table occupied at this point with about 5 people. There were two guys at the back counter ordering their food maybe, we weren't sure. So after waiting about 5 minutes, we went to the back counter. Perhaps this is where you order. Someone finally came from the back, walked right past us and didn't say a word. He was the same guy that was helping the 2 men earlier.
At this point, we decided to leave. I've never gone to a restaurant and received this type of (non) service. I dunno. Maybe we had magic invisible powers and just didn't know it. 

I don't plan to return. They don't deserve my time or money if this is how they treat customers.

Owner blamed Yelp for the error on $5 for $10 deal which cannot be used during lunch. I got the goat curry. The goat curry was just ok. It had lots of fat which gave a pretty strong goat taste. The fried plantains were very good. Rice and cabbages were ok. Good service.

Talk about an inexpensive dinner choice.  This was very much worth the drive from downtown for a very memorable meal.

Extensive menu with all of the traditional Vietnamese options.  I went with the pho and was not disappointed.  It had a rich broth that was reminiscent of some of the best street food I experienced in Hanoi.  

Here's the best part - a woman about the age of my mother came out to check on our table.  She had bright purple hair and was a total blast!  Her service was spot on, she was genuinely interested in our dining experience, and even gave us some recommendations of off menu secrets (let's just say they have some amazing secret curry dishes).   

This was an unexpected delight.  Nothing fancy but great food, reasonable prices, and a staff that makes you feel at home.

Went here for lunch and I'll be back for sure. 

The atmosphere was relaxed and chill unlike almost every other Pho place I've been. Sade was playing in the background.

Egg rolls were tasty and crispy. Bun was mostly fresh and pickled vegetables with a little noodle and great savory meat.

3.5 stars rounded down.
We visited on a weekend, and enjoyed our lunch.

The good:
- Friendly service, nice staff.
- Delicious rolls and appetizers
- Terrific sauces (peanut, sweet/sour) with rolls
- Better-than-average decor and clean restrooms (compared to similar Pho establishments)
- Unique and tasty fried rice options
- Decent Pho Ga broth

The not so good:
- As mentioned in other reviews: proteins.  Probably the only Pho place I've been where the chicken in the soup was actually DRY. Think about how hard that would be to pull off. Something is definitely wrong here.
Similar situation with the meats in our fried rice dish... Tasty, but not fresh. Slightly slightly off smell with pork in the spring rolls, but that did not stop us from devouring them.

All in all, a good Pho place. If management could take the proteins up a notch, this could be one of the best in Dallas (I've eaten at dozens of Vietnamese restaurants). 

We will likely visit again.

One of the few Vietnamese places in DFW  with seafood pho (pho hai san) consisting of crab, squid, fish balls, and shrimp. It was average though.

Clean place, friendly service, and large menu. 

Prices are $9 - $12 for the most part, with some cheaper items like the sandwiches (banh mi) going for $6.

The food was fresh and the other plates looked good. I'll have to come back to try the other offerings.

I sit down at Pho Troung. Waiter "hello what are you in the mood for?"  Me " what do you recommend?" ..waiter "can I surprise you?" Yes. 
I HATE ordering. I wish I lived in the old west and just order "whiskey and a steak"
Anyway he brought me beef bun and it was fantastic, even comped me spring rolls. 
I've eaten here several times and it's always fresh and delicious and the people are great.  Free wifi also.

I'd normally take off a star (or 2) for the negative aspects such as lack of bar space, limited and pricey wines-by-the-glass options, but no. Their hospitality and delicate, delicious and oh so fresh menu items far surpass anything that might have bummed you out (temporarily).
Having said that though, prepare to wait if you don't have a reservation. They will however sell cocktails while you await your seat:)! 
I love the veggie dishes and whatever fresh crudo/ceviche they are serving... You can't go wrong with anything though. Cheers

Went there a couple of months back for my birthday.  Everybody in the group enjoyed just about everything.  We had one mishap.  I think a salad came out that was visually stunning but not dressed.  The service was spot on.  I had the rabbit pappardelle, and really enjoyed it.

The environment was comfortable and welcoming.  The service was attentive without being overbearing.  

At this price point I expect nothing less.

I was far underwhelmed by this place after hearing the buzz around it shortly after its opening.

The atmosphere, interior, food, and service was all below my expectations, but maybe I just had really high expectations.

With that said, things that stood out:
- the fig scone/bread and the oat bread (yes, all their breads served at the beginning of the meal were wonderful!)
- fried olives/warm pecans
- oysters
- meatballs
- shaved asparagus

Note, the place is pronounced Jemma, which is Latin for previous gem.

Nice location, but I don't think I'll be back.

QUICK HIT (Must Go vs. Consider Checking It Out vs. Pass/Don't Bother): Consider Checking It Out

Let me say at the outset that my two dining experiences at Gemma were both decent. Maybe my underwhelming dinners at Gemma were caused by high expectations set by local food critics or yelp elitists, or perhaps by the fact that I ate at two true Napa institutions (The French Laundry and Terra) 1.5 months prior to my last visit...regardless, I just wasn't overly impressed with Gemma, and nor were my guests.

Gemma is located on Henderson road near Lower Greenville area. Valet parking, although complimentary, is required. Both times I have had reservations, and Gemma has been prompt in seating me upon arrival at those times. The restaurant itself is nice. The tables are quite close together, however I never felt "cramped" nor felt that my conversation could easily be heard by other diners. The restaurant volume is moderate, but not loud enough to prevent good conversation. 

The drink menu is quite extensive (beer, wine, cocktails). Good variety of offerings. Bread service comes frequently (the in-house made breads are fantastic). At both visits, I tried several appetizers, salads, shareable plates, and a few of my guests entrees. I do enjoy the menu at Gemma - approachable menu without being too extensive, unique items, creative. A few of the items on the menu read better than they actually tasted. Some recent items were flavorless (Crudo), while others were incredibly oversalted (ribeye special). Some items were table hits (artichokes, turkey meatballs, ricotta cavatelli, duck breast). Overall, mixed reviews on taste from my dining guests. 

The servers have always been incredibly personable, charismatic, and friendly each time. I think the service could be a bit more polished for this caliber of dining - (three different waiters came to our table asking for our drinks unknowing that they had already been taken, water was mistakenly poured into my wine glass...yes seriously, but they did replace the wine). Regardless, the dinner service was like clock-work. Very little wait time between dishes. I enjoyed the ordering of served dishes as dictated by the kitchen. Water was quickly filled when low. Drink orders were requested when appropriate. 

Overall, Gemma was an "A-OK" dining experience (per Yelp stratification).

My friends and I arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday evening with reservations. It was not busy when we got there, but the place filled up real quick after we settled down. It was a cute little place, with simple and classic decor. Sadly, all of us were underwhelmed with the food and agreed that the complimentary bread given in the beginning was the best part of our meal. My friends ordered the Duck Breast and Confit Leg and Pappardelle. They both said they would not get the same dishes if they were to return. I got the Baked Oysters and Turkey Meatballs. I liked the oysters, but they were tiny. Flavor-wise, they could not compete with ones I have had in New Orleans. There was nothing special about the meatballs. Having tried the ones at Neighborhood Services, my standards are higher now.

Pretty sure this was the best BBQ of my life (at least to date!). Pecan Lodge was highly recommended to us and now I know why.

We went here with friends that were visiting from out of town as a "welcome to Texas" meal. 

We ended up going for a later dinner, instead of the popular lunch time, to help beat the crowd. Fortunately, we were able to walk right up and order immediately. 

My husband and I split the two meats, one side order, and also ordered dessert (...had to!). We had the pulled pork, brisket (AH-MAZING), mac and cheese and the banana pudding. Everything was so good but the brisket was out of this world tender. Splitting between the two of us was more than enough food. We left properly stuffed to the gills!

It's official, my barbecue experience in Austin has spoiled me. A few weeks prior to my visit to Pecan Lodge, I had the most amazing barbecue experience at la Barbecue in Austin. Naturally, I compared Pecan Lodge to this experience and unfortunately it fell short. I was really hoping for a Dallas barbecue joint to impress me, but that wasn't the case here.

I went on a Saturday night and there was a decent line, but not too long. It moves pretty quickly. The atmosphere inside is pretty nice and has plenty of seating. They also have a nice outdoor seating area. The good news is the food comes out pretty quickly, but the bad news is that the food isn't so great. Unfortunately, they were sold out of the beef rib so I ordered the brisket and a side of fried okra. The brisket wasn't very good... Not only did it have a poor taste, but it didn't melt in my mouth and was tough to cut/eat which should not be the case. I didn't finish my brisket and opted not to take it home with me because it was disappointing. On the bright side, at least the fried okra was good. My friend ordered the hot mess (a loaded sweet potato with barbacoa on top) and it was surprisingly good even though I don't like sweet potato. They balanced the sweetness with the saltiness of the meat pretty well. My only criticism of the hot mess is that some of the barbacoa on top was very tough, to the point where it wasn't edible. This was only a portion of the barbacoa though, the rest of it was fine. Despite liking the hot mess, Pecan Lodge doesn't deliver the quality of meat that I expect from a barbecue restaurant. I never imagined not liking brisket to the point where I don't finish it nor take it home. 

It is possible that Pecan Lodge was having an off day so I will probably give it another shot at a time where they aren't sold out of the beef rib. However, the more likely reality is that if you've had great barbecue outside of Dallas, Pecan Lodge is likely to disappoint. I hope they prove me wrong the next time I visit.

On my search for the discovery of the meaning of Texas barbecue, I come across Pecan Lodge , in Texas. Based on my recollection that place has been mentioned on Food Network.

First impressions, its located in a downtown trendy area and yet it still manages a hometown feel. The restaurant itself draws me in, as I notice the place has a line even on a weekday during lunch time.

Ambiance is trendy and functional, this would also the place I get to try Maine Root sodas, I strongly recommend the Blueberry flavor.

Now to the barbecue, I went with a plater that included brisket, rib, and pulled pork. The brisket was good and had the smoke lines that people talk about. Maybe it was an off day for them since I was not really impressed with the rib and pulled pork.

Nonetheless, I would still come back and try other sauces and other combinations in the future.

I've been waiting so long to try this place and was not disappointed. We went at noon and I hate having to pay for parking, but the $5 was worth it. We had to wait in a short line outside and were willing to brave the cold since the store's front door was open and the smells of BBQ filled the air. 

However, the line inside was crazy. It wraps around the line of the restaurant and it goes pretty slow, as only one cashier was at the register (there was another register right next to him, and another guy, but he moved to the empty to-go order line). It took us almost a half hour to make it to the front and once you're there you want to try everything. It's kid of pricey when you start choosing more than one item, and there's no need because everything is surprisingly filling. Once you order, you get your name called in under a couple of minutes. 

Be careful cause there's definitely not enough tables for the crowd. You just have to awkwardly walk around scoping out finishing diners. There is a large patio area outside, but it's not tolerable when it's 50 degrees outside. The tables are cleared as soon as people leave them, but somehow ours never was so I stacked the old cups and napkins in the corner and put my plate down. 

The Hot Mess potato, the sweet potato with barbocoa, sour cream, cheese, and other potato toppings was out of this world good. It's one of the cheapest things on the menu, at $9, and is totally filling. I would definitely make the trip just for that. However, we couldn't stop there. The Mac and cheese is incredible and has that unbelievable homemade flavor. Then for dessert I had the peach cobbler and was absolutely in love. It was way too much food, but they keep to go boxes at the pickup window specifically for girls like me whose eyes are bigger than there stomachs. 

In conclusion: definitely stay in line once you realize it's long because the food is 100% worth the weight. Scope out the best tables, as they go fast, and be willing to sit with trash still on your table. Come on an empty stomach and get ready to fall in love.

Best BBQ meat I have tasted in Texas to date. The only real complaints is the craziness (overstuffed with guests) on the weekends, and the low-quality side dishes. 

The ribs, chicken and other selections are extremely tasteful and near perfect... Literally.
#####

The food is rustic yet upscale.  The tastes are on point - basically no duds on the menu (and I've had almost everything by this point).

Recommendations:
Farm Bird: it's just a chicken, but it's a perfectly cooked chicken.  Excellent and safe to recommend for non-adventurous eaters.
OMG Burger: serious, solid burger with a ridiculous amount of mushrooms.
3 Little Pigs: these three pulled pork sliders are billed as a side, but they make a great stand alone entree.
Whiskey Cake: if you don't get this every time you come here, you might need to see a doctor about your dying tastebuds.

How could a restaurant with the words whiskey and cake in it NOT be amazing? This was such a fun place to eat and the perfect place to take out-of-towners (which was me) since the restaurant had unique twists on average dishes and quirky decor throughout. I tried the Farmer's Breakfast and the Chicken & Waffles, which totally stole the show. Don't overlook the thick-cut, spicy bacon though- order it as a side if you have to. 

P.S.- they also have ramen!

Awesome place! Service was amazing. My sister, my boyfriend and I got on the wait and were told about 30-45 minutes, which was as to be expected for a Friday night. We waited outside on a sofa when a waitress walked over and asked if we wanted to sit outside in her section. Sure! We waited not even 10 minutes! On a Friday night!! Yay! 
Our server was Lori and she was very knowledgable about the menu without sounding rehearsed. She suggested items and explained them beyond what the menu described. 
I had the guava gimlet .. so tasty! 
We started with the goat cheese fondue which was amazing!! You have to try it! 
My sister and I split the chicken and cheese melt and I loved that our food came out already split and plated for us. My boyfriend had the OMG burger which was huge! 
And of course for dessert we had the whiskey cake! YUM 
Overall we had a wonderful night. Phenomenal service. ASK FOR LORI.

Came here for after dinner drinks. My friend and I sat at the bar, we were greeted right away. The drinks were made well and the service was friendly. After a disappointing dessert experience at The Keg, I decided to try the whiskey cake here. So...much...better. The cake was decadent and it was balanced nicely with fresh whipped cream.
#####

The food here is really good but they need more main entree items. There is like 10 items to choose from and the rest are appetizers. A small list of items to choose from boosts your profit because it takes you less time to look at the menu.which means you can order faster and seat people faster. These people who made the menu are smart.  I got the basic burger and was still hungry. It takes a lot to get me full. I think they also have vegetarian options as well.

Best fried chicken-hands down! The negative reviews on here might be due to an off day or something. Seriously, this chicken is addicting!!! I find myself thinking about and craving big mama's chicken from time to time. I wish they'd open up these little stands everywhere? There is something in the seasoning that just has me hooked like hooked on phonics. Deeeeelicious. Prices are great! I have had the liver and also the fried chicken baskets. ALWAYS order extra seasoning!! I wish there was one in Far North Dallas and also in Denton. I need to find out what they put in that seasoning!

I try my best to support black owned businesses but my people sure do make it difficult. 

Now, I've patronized this restaurant for several years because I loved how flavorful their food is. I normally buy the wing dinner. However, a few weeks ago I stopped by this restaurant and bought their wings and I made it home and was shocked to see I had spent $9.00 on what appeared to be tiny wings from a cornish hen. In fact, as I have on occasion cooked cornish hen, they were SMALLER than the wings of a Cornish Hen. I had never, ever seen wings that small. In no grocery store anywhere. Four wings could have been put together to make one normal sized wing. It looked like the wings came from a baby chick. I realized 'my people' had 'ripped me off'. 

I won't be returning.

If you like bland chicken (Popeyes and Chicken Express taste waaaay better) with feathers still attached to the wings, be my guest. The waffles were soggy and the fries were cold (like "cooked an hour ago"cold). 
The gizzards would've been edible had they had a slight hint of salt, pepper, and garlic. I'm all for supporting small businesses, but damn---give me a worthy product. 
FYI--there are only two tables in the joint, so unless you live around the corner, you'll be eating the lukewarm blandness in your car or lap. 
Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but the best thing they've got is the Red Koolaid for 1.39 a cup. 
No second chances here.

My daughter and myself went on a Wednesday and apparently on Wednesdays they don't have waffles we were ordering the family meal with one waffle, they lady said oh we don't have no waffles today so I sat there in amazement and had to reread the the name of the place because it was our first time there and it said Momma's Waffle and Chicken BUT they don't have waffles that day hmmm something is suspicious about that! I'm still saying to myself how do you NOT have one of your main items! Poor management and this is why I don't like visiting some businesses sometimes because they run out of main things! On a better note the chicken was the best I had ever had! I loved the fries the seasoning on it is awesome and the side of Jalapeno peppers and pickles and carrots was off the chain!

I definitely think this place gets a solid 3 stars - equal goods to bads.  

The good:  Prices are pretty cheap.  A two piece basket could potentially feed me for two meals (the chicken is pretty heavy and filling) and it's all for $2.99!  The seasoning is amazing, and I want a bucket of it to dump on everything I eat in the future. I also really enjoyed the waffle... but I'm also not exactly type who's very picky about their waffles. 

The bad:  while the seasoning is good, the meat under the skin I found to be bland, and I found myself really only wanting to eat the skin. The chicken itself wasn't crispy enough, but it may be because it was a 30 minute drive through traffic before I reached home (you really don't want to eat there... it's not the safest neighborhood).   The main grievance I have is the service.  A young lady took my order and she did NOT look happy to be there or to be interacting with me in any way.  An older lady (could it be Big Mama herself??!) took my cash and gave me change.  She had a very friendly demeanor, but unfortunately gave me the wrong change.  She was more than nice about it when I brought it to her attention though.

Delicious quick and convenient. Order 100% correct!

All varieties are recommended from the breakfast tacos (get everything - potato, egg, meat, cheese - and add salsa and crema) to the brisket, fish, vegetarian, pork, shrimp, Picadillo, and the quesadillas. 

Corn and flour tortillas are equally good, though the flour hold up better for breakfast. I'd suggest the adding the cilantro and onion.

This is a quick corner taco joint, if you are looking for a gourmet Mexican or Tex-mex experience it's not the place. If you want some good yummy tacos to curb your craving this is for you.
#####

Absolutly nothing special. 
No real bbq flavor on the bbq taco
No real shrimp flavor or batter crunch 
Bottled soda semi cold
No atmosphere
No reason to return

Food was sub par, to go order was wrong when we got home, guy at register had no clue and had a piss poor attitude, and what in the hell are these tiny tacos? I opened the bag to what looked like a foil wrapped brownie....and why did we get two tortillas per taco? Its not like theres enough inside to split them up 
After eating two tacos I feel like i hadn't even eaten a real meal. 

WAYYYY TO MUCH HYPE OVER THIS PLACE...I thought this place was going to be a new Torchy's Tacos (Austin) or Taco Shack (Austin) type place for us since were new to Dallas, but thats a big negative. I will not be returning because lets face it i can go to a number of other places and get a better result.

Great breakfast taco spot. Brisket egg taco, Bean Cheese Egg, Potato Egg Cheese. Tacos are an important breakfast food. Great vibe at this morning stop.

So as everyone has said before me, the parking sucks here! 
Now on to the food! 
We ordered 2 shrimp tacos,a beef fajita one and a chicken fajita one as well! 

Personally I like the beef the best, it really reminded me of ghetto tacos. The beef was nice and flavorful, the only problem is that there really is not texture diff. The beef is soft, the onions are soft and the tortilla is soft.... there needs to be something diff because it gets mushy after you eat more than 2 bites! 
the shrimp was good as  well but there was way to much sauce. idk if the shrimp is fresh but it's cooked nicely with a crispy shell and putting the amount of sauce on top makes the shrimp soggy if it sits too long.  Also the sause overpowered the rest of the other flavors. 

The chicken was okay, it was a little on the dry side but it was okay. 

As somewhere I have heard amazing things about and been dying to try. It was just okay. It could be better but it's Def better than Fuzzy ' s. 

I would come back if I was in the area.

This place is legit. I've been about 6 times in the past year or so. I think it's one of the best options for Japanese food in Irving. It's a traditional looking izakaya style restaurant from the inside. Their portions are great for sharing with most dishes under $10. What I really like are the eclectic dishes - it's not your run of the mill place. They have multiple ramens (miso, tonkatsu, taiwan) also only do half sizes now. Highlights on my visits have been the takoyaki, karaage, rice sandwich, grilled squid, grill mackerel, tempura, tonkotsu ramen. 

They also have shōchū, no i'm not talking about soju. Drink it neat or with a few ice cubes, so delicious. If your go-to Japanese place doesn't have this then you're doing it wrong.
#####

This place is a little hidden, but it's a big hit. The atmosphere is really cozy here and everyone greets you in Japanese when you come in and when you leave. The food is amazing. I've been here 4-5 times and it was pretty much back to back because it was addicting food. 

You know the place is authentic when Japanese people are there all the time to dine. They have really fresh ingredients. Try their yellow tail, it just melts in your mouth. 

I've tried half of their menu and wish I didn't love it so much because I keep reordering and haven't tried other things yet. This place would not disappoint if you appreciate authentic Japanese food. 

Don't come here if you want to order rolls. Because there are no such things.

This is my first visit after several years and so-so experience. I heard that it is under a new management and saw that the interior is updated. 
I ordered tonkotsu ramen, fried chicken cartilage, egg, and gyutan. I can recommend the ramen but will not order the cartilage again. I tasted only oil. 
The broth was very thick and the color was almost brown, but it was delicious. It's even tastier added with the egg. I was surprised the egg was better than ramen Santouka's. 
All those plus green tea and a scoop of matcha ice cream only cost $24. I'm a happy customer and will buy again.
#####

This place is indeed authentic. However, I was not impressed with the food. I tried the tonkatsu once, but it was fried too hard. I couldn't even tasted the pork. On another occasion, I tried the shoyu ramen. Believe me, you can get the same taste from an instant ramen (Myojo Chukazanmai brand). I had better ramen somewhere else.

Located in the trifecta that is sushi restaurants down belt line in Irving. I come here to grab a light snack of just some grub. The food style here is unique and authentic. It is referred to as Izakaya. Mostly a drinking place like a "bar" and they serve multitudes of appetizers. Very fun to come and enjoy and chat with friends. They DO NOT have sushi so know that before stepping in. 

The one absolute thing you must must try is the Takoyaki octopus balls. It. Is. Literally. The. Best. EVER. It is served in an authentic Takoyaki cast iron skillet still sizzling and it just makes your heart churn. I would definitely come 30 minutes just for the Takoyaki!

'Another day another burger' I thought,  headed down to burger house on Hillcrest Avenue at Snider Plaza. 
Luckily I had a friend who absolutely steered me down to dive coastal cuisine restaurant and my first question was where is all the beef and fried foods?

Well they did have some beef but mostly I started reading the menu and was totally surprised to see some really strong & interesting flavor combos and some interesting dishes, so I ordered the fire calamari as well the Oyster Banh Mi -fried oysters with Sri racha aoli on ciabatta bun (heavenly pillowy soft). 
Let me tell you it was nothing short of spectacular. 
Also: Ginger gimlet margarita and delicious plantain chips!

I could rave on & on about the food with superlatives but the truth is that it all just tasted so fresh and had the most interesting flavor combinations so it was a unique experience for my tastebuds! 

If you're swinging by this area don't let the casual café style fool you they are dead serious about their cooking and you should definitely try it!

yum Yum Yum.  Had their Ahi Tuna wrap and it melted in my mouth!!! Their tea is good as well!  Their chips were interesting but not my style. A friend had their hearts of palms salad and I thought it looked amazing as did everything coming out of their kitchen.  The line was a little long for 7 pm on a weeknight but well worth the wait.

I came on a Wednesday, early evening. Stopped in to find a place to hide out while avoiding traffic. The Crab BLT was amazing. Thick cut bacon, lots of crab meat, crisp lettuce; all the sandwich elements were superb and complimentary. 

I'm not sure how they made their super thin fries, but they were delicious. Definitely made in-house and it shows. The service was quick and courteous with friendly and helpful staff. 

Staff recommended the Crab BLT when I was torn between food choices. I'm glad I followed their suggestion. The glass of wine was a great addition and I enjoyed their overall atmosphere, a mix of SMU students, professionals and small families. I definitely plan on coming again the next time I'm in the area to explore other menu options.

This is a great place to get a wide variety of fresh high quality seafood in the middle of the city. I love their iced tea bar! It's an iced tea lover's dream! This little restaurant will make you feel like you're on vacation. Parking in Snider Plaza can be tricky around lunch hour though.

The good: I had the jumbo lump crab blt and it was awesome. I definitely recommend it. The place is nice and the service was great. 

The bad: The price. I paid $18 for a sandwich with a side of chips. I understand it is crab but I just felt like that was too much. I may have felt more justified had the side been better. I think the chips were house made,  I'm not sure. What I am sure of is that they aren't very good. 

Overall, it's definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared to spend almost $20 on a sandwich and order something other than chips as your side.
#####

I am not going to beat around the bush. This place is really good. I have had Thai boat noodles soup, Yen Ta Four, Curry puffs and Chicken wings, and nothing disappoints me so far. The service is always nice. 

I have lived in Dallas for 2 years. I had tried many Thai places, but just a few amaze me. Bangkok Dee just beat others and become my no. 1 favorite.
#####

I recently moved to the Northwest Dallas area and kept passing this place on the way to work every day. I was curious because it's in this weird and unassuming little shopping strip just off the highway and most of the time, those weird little places tend to be gems. 

Bangkok Dee is definitely good, but I've never had bad Thai food so I can't say what caliber of Thai food it is.  I just know that when I go there to either dine in or take out, it's consistent.  I can't knock the place for anything major except that sometimes it takes awhile for your food to get to your table and many of the appetizers cost as much as the entrees (but I think that's the case mostly everywhere).  A little advice in the spice dept - the medium is pretty damn spicy.  If you aren't a spice person, go mild.  Even for a person like myself that can handle it, the medium is still pretty spicy.  Last night I ordered the green curry medium spicy for take out and paid for it this morning.  No regrets though.

I am a big fan of ordering take out from Bangkok Dee via the Eat24 App via Yelp. It's easy and it takes under 30 minutes for your food to be ready for pick up. Plus it's the best food within a 5 minute drive from me.

I had my first bad meal here today. The crispy orange chicken; It was fried up nicely but then put in a container with the sauce all around it.. duh to the cook.. it was soggy and I tossed it in the trash quickly.

I called in, spoke to one of the two lovely women who work the front counter. I advised her of my bad meal, she offered to take care of me next time I came in.

Guess what, I will keep coming in. 

Now, the good; So far I have had the Pad Thai w/ chicken. It is tasty and they'll make it super hot/spicy if you'd like.

My favorite is the BKK Dumplings on the appetizer menu.

I hope to explore the menu a bit more and enjoy their food.

I think next time I go it will be the Yellow Curry on the lunch menu with some BKK dumplings w/ sticky rice & mango.

I love this place for their cheap lunch specials, friendly waitresses and variety of Thai fare.  Their lunch specials are under $10 and include either an egg roll or small chicken tom yum.

They have the usual palatable dishes like Pad Thai, red/yellow/blue curry, fried rice and tom yum/kha.  To me, they taste more or less the same than any affordable Thai restaurant in the area. Although, your nose will not run here at all. It is true that their food is on the sweeter side, but that is fine by me.

The less popular dishes keep me coming back though. I don't often find pink noodle soup, or yen ta fo (in their case: yen ta four). Theirs is loaded with fish balls, shrimp and flat noodles. The soup is sweet on its own, but they bring out dried chili flakes so you can spice it up as you wish. I would still call it the "friendly" version, but it is my favorite dish here and perfect for a rainy day. This is the second place in Dallas that I've found yen ta fo at.

The terrible part is how slow the service is after you order your food. It is not really a quick lunch place unless you get your lazy butt up and specifically ask for your check.  They also deliver through EAT24!

Hair in my curry puffs 
I'm beyond disgusted 
I'm never buying from this place again 
I guess no one wears a hair net anymore 
I called the business and they didn't even understand what I was saying. They are bringing another one but I think I'll pass on everything I ordered.

We drive here from Frisco on Saturdays and it's totally worth it. We found this place after a long search for a real bakery near us. 
The only negative: not so near. 

Petition to open one up north! Plano/Addison/Frisco/Allen would be happy to have such a wonderful treat!

OK, a lot has been written about this place. And, it's safe to say, this is officially our favorite neighborhood bakery, and my waistline reflects the tastiness of their goods. And, the staff is wonderful (thanks, SMU Theater Company!)

In short, there's something wonderful for just about every visitor. It's truly a great bakery. If one pastry is not your favorite, try a couple others until you find your sweet spot. You'll be glad you did.

Having glowed sufficiently, I have to say that POPULARITY has not helped this bakery. Like many other businesses, the more visitors, the more volume, and unfortunately, lower quality has followed. And of course, prices have gone up.

Example: bigger croissants are not necessarily better croissants. Less time to prep the day before means less consistent breads the next day. 

Another example: my favorite laminated brioche is almost twice as expensive as it was last year, and the consistency and quality is down (inconsistent baking, level of dough rise, over crisped, etc). 

So, Village Baking Co has officially MADE IT. They are terrific. Here's hoping they can institute processes to keep the quality high. One idea: break off the commercial baking component to another location, allowing your top crew to focus on higher quality, higher margin end-customer goods. We're responsible for DOZENS of regular buyers at VBCo, and too many have mentioned similar slips in quality over the last 6 months. Keep it together, and keep your regulars happy!

This place is such a hidden gem!!! I had heard from a friend who previously lived in Paris that this little bakery was very authentic (especially their baguettes), so I had to try it out. I could only go in the evening when the pastries weren't as fresh, but they were still delicious.

I ordered a plain croissant and a raspberry kouign amann (which was recommended by the employee). The croissant was pretty good, though I wish it were a little lighter and flakier. I assumed it was because I came too late in the day. The kouign amann was amazing! It was perfectly sweet and caramelized on the outside and gooey on the inside. I can't wait to try more things in the future!

The best bakery in dfw as the croissants are incredible and all the breads are repeatable.  The service is very knowledgable on the products and you should go early if you want options as they sell out.

The Village Baking Co is definitely a hole in the wall bakery. Upon entering the parking lot, you have to swerve a bit to avoid the huge potholes. Pop a tire or scrape your bumper if you don't enter with caution!

This bakery bakes all their goodies in-house and you get the nice cozy feel when entering in. The outside depicts a French feel to it (you definitely forget you're in Dallas).

I ordered the kouign amannan (vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon) (what? I couldn't decided!). The outside was beautifully caramelized as the center held a fluffy texture like a croissant. My eye was definitely bigger than my stomach as one pastry will fill you up, let alone three!

I wish I was able to order more pastries to try them since there's nothing better than fresh baked pastries, but I only have one stomach :(

If you're traveling and trying to grab a quick morning snack - I'd recommend this place, but just one pastry though or you'll encounter morning food coma.

This place is perfect for someone that doesn't know what they want to eat.  They have a variety of everything and everything that I have tried has been beyond perfect.  

Try the pesto hummus and the Chocolate cake

Loveeeee coming here for lunch. EatZi's is part grocery store and part restaurant. I usually come here if I'm in need of a dish to bring to a potluck party and the employees are sooooo helpful. I've never experienced bad customer service each time I come here. 

Certain items could be a little pricey but in the end its worth it. My favorite items would be the ground turkey meatloaf and the sandwiches. They provide a great selection of on-the-go meals and offer a healthy option as well. The wine selection is great too!

Making the decision to go to Eatzi's always leads to good thing! I recommend everyone to try it at least once!

eatZi's is one of those places that is so popular and well known that everyone just sort of assumes it's a nationwide chain (it's not, and while there used to be Atlanta and Chicago locations it's now confined to DFW). That's a testament to how good of a job eatZi's does; and while I can appreciate the diversity of options, I can't say that the quality at eatZi's is enough to sway me away from the likes of Central Market and Whole Foods. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Contrary to what the neon signage out front might imply, eatZi's has a nice mom and pop vibe on the inside. Stations and queues are orderly and the process moves quickly thanks to everything being well-staffed. What more could you ask for?

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Prices at eatZi's are on par with those of Whole Foods and Central Market, and there's definitely some great value here. I opted for a large sandwich at the sandwich bar for $10.00, and as you can see this was certainly more than enough to feed two or count as two meals. Other items ranging from pasta to salads and breakfast items are priced comparably, and there was nothing (unlike Whole Foods) that made me think "are you kidding me?" That's a value win. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

While the wide range of sandwich options was impressive, it was here that the quality fell a bit short. Here's a quick breakdown of my sandwich:

- Wheat Bonebread
- Hot Pepper Spread
- Mayo
- Lettuce
- Turkey Pastrami

While the wheat bonebread was worthy of awards (as were all the other breads based on what I was seeing), the turkey pastrami was painfully dry, and the other meats (they're all right there in front of you) appeared significantly dried out as well. This was helped a bit by the mayo and pepper spread, but at the end of the day I still found myself with a very dry sandwich. Another gripe came in the form of topping selection, and while the basic were here, I longed for options like jalapenos, banana peppers, etc. All in all, a good sandwich, but not a great one. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

If we were only talking about variety here? Yes, but quality is key, and my experience at eatZi's left a bit to be desired in that department. No Star Granted.

Absolutely love this place.

Pretty much everything is amazing and fresh

The only place I don't mind paying $12 for a salad, regular old Caesar salad is my go to

Pair that with their citrus water that they have for free and you have an amazing lunch.

I love there for Friday special of a pizza and a bottle of wine for $25, makes it for Friday night meal so simple and less of a hassle of what to eat or where to go

Highlights: Caesar salad, citrus water, corn bread, mozzarella tomato pasta

I'm torn because I have a love/hate relationship with eatZi's. Here's my I love you / I love you not list:

Love:
+ the gourmet style market
+ the quality ingredients
+ the freshness
+ the samples
+ the desserts
+ the red dot special (from 9-10pm daily some of the prepared foods are BOGO)

Hate:
- Prices
- Prices
- Prices

When I feel like splurging I go to during the red dot special hour to ensure at least I'm getting a little bit of a deal. The products are great, but the foods are a bit steep for my wallet.

Why is there not a place like this where I  live?! I've missed stuff like this ever since I went vegan. They have got it down!
I couldn't decide on one thing, so I got several... The sausage and Dayia cheese kolache, the veggie dog jalapeño kolache, the Turco empanada and the Boston cream donut. They were all delicious and the empanada and sausage kolache were exceptional! Where have you been all my life, Reverie?

The young man who helped me was friendly and helpful. He told me what's popular and steered me in the right direction (though in pretty sure nothing's in the wrong direction here). 

The space is small - really no seating within the bakery. There are, however, about three tables out front if you'd like to munch there. 

All in all, a delightful experience (seriously, dat empanada doh! Try it! You won't be sorry).

Having heard such rave reviews, I wanted so desperately to be blown away by Reverie Bakeshop as I've really yet to find a baked goods spot here in Dallas that can compete with some of the staples in New York City and California. While Reverie has some good options, I'm not convinced that I've yet found my Dallas go-to. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

One thing I will say is that the service and atmosphere at Reverie are excellent, and the fast and friendly staff are clearly passionate about what they do. Want to know details about the ingredients or the baking process? Done. Need some specialty items for an event? Done. Want to just shoot the breeze with a friendly face? Done. Whether you're in to have a seat and some coffee or on the go for a fast snack, Reverie provides a great service and atmosphere. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

For better or for worse, baked goods are commanding a premium these days, and having paid $7.00 during my most recent visit to Dominique Ansel in New York City for a frozen s'more I don't even know what to expect these days. Here at Reverie it's expensive but not yet totally out of control. While $2.50 is a bit much for a standard chocolate chip cookie given you can get them for under $1 at Tiff's Treats and $3.00 is slightly steep for a smaller cup cake, I realized when I thought about it that I was more often than not paying roughly that for gourmet donuts in the area these days, and are cup cakes or cookies so different? Reverie is on the edge here price wise, but there's still value to be found. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

So here we were, a chocolate chip cookie (not pictured) and an Apple Pie cup cake (pictured). Were they good? They were good, but honestly neither blew me away. The chocolate chip cookie did have some ingredient that I can't quite place that made it in my mind better than say Tiff's Treats of Pokey O's, but the cup cake was a real let down. I appreciated the actual apples in the center (although it was a minuscule amount), but the frosting on top didn't taste different from what I've had from a the store and the cup cake itself was dry and without too much of it's own flavor to speak of. Again I won't say I disliked either, but neither blew me away. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Reverie Bakeshop is good, and with their top notch service and atmosphere complimenting an ever changing lineup of goods you should check it out, but I can't say that they'll become my go-to bakeshop in the area. No Star Granted.

I ordered the most beautiful custom cake for my best friend's birthday. This cake wasn't on their normal list of flavored, but the my were willing to make it anyway! The cake was amazing! 

I also love their oatmeal cookie sandwich, pumpkin cinnamon roll, and I've been known to stop in for a mid day Kolache snack! 

I'm not a huge fan of their donuts, but everything else is great!!!!

Tried four different items, not a fan of any. Desserts were bland and tasteless. I would not recommend. They get an extra start because the girl behind the counter was nice.

This place is awesome. I came here like 3 times before I realized they were vegan. That is the true test of a good bakery when something is healthy but you can't taste a difference. 

No one wants to eat healthy and feel like they are eating healthy. 

They are reasonably priced and are always friendly. I have never had anything I did not like.
