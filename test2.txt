If you like bland chicken (Popeyes and Chicken Express taste waaaay better) with feathers still attached to the wings, be my guest. The waffles were soggy and the fries were cold (like "cooked an hour ago"cold). 
The gizzards would've been edible had they had a slight hint of salt, pepper, and garlic. I'm all for supporting small businesses, but damn---give me a worthy product. 
FYI--there are only two tables in the joint, so unless you live around the corner, you'll be eating the lukewarm blandness in your car or lap. 
Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but the best thing they've got is the Red Koolaid for 1.39 a cup. 
No second chances here.
